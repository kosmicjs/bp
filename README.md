# BP

This is a simple development repo for future @kosmic packages. Currently there are no stable APIs and there are no published packages. They are all being developed in tandem.

# Current Feature Roadmaps

1) Server side templates powered by preact (amazing dev experience with TypeScript)!
   - Allows for "islands" like architecture using preact if desired
   - htmx built in for server first state management
2) Next js style server routing with support for any koa middleware (fs-router)
3) A relatively unnopinionated koa server with lots of good defaults and some pluggable options (Core)
4) An amazing dev experiences with hot-module reloading, error recovery, browser reloading and HMR when appropriate.
